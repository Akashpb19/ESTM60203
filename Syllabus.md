# ESTM 60203 Introduction to Applied Operations Research #

*ESTM 60203: Introduction to Applied Operations Research* provides students with a an introduction to selected concepts and analytical tools of Operations Research with broad application in business and process operations. 

## Catalog Description ##

Introduction to the applications of operations research including blending problems, scheduling, project management, performance analysis, supply chains, job shops, and inventory management. Through case studies, students will learn how to use available optimization tools to solve problems arising in operations management. Special emphasis will be given to the role of uncertainty and risk in business operations.

## Topics #

The Operations Management component of the ESTEEM program will be taught in a series of fourteen 75 minute classroom discussions. Coverage will correspond to the topics listed below, with relative emphasis and additional topics dependent on student interest.

### 1. Working with Constraints

* What is optimization?
* Objectives, constraints, actual prices and shadow costs. 
* What optimization can tell you about your business.

### 2. Modeling Business Decisions ###

* Elements of modeling business decisions.
* How to find solution to optimization problems.
* Mixing, assignment, transportation, flow, and other commons paradigm for business decisions.  
* Critical Path, PERT, and other applications to project management

### 3. Planning and Scheduling ###

* Job shops and flow shops
* Empirical scheduling methods
* Optimal scheduling for bottleneck operations
* Vehicle routing and other logistical problems.

### 4. Supply Chains and Dynamics ###

* Supply chain dynamics and the role of information (Beer Game Simulation)
* Inventory Management
* Direct simulation of warehouse, manufacturing, and other business operations.

### 5. Uncertainty, Risk, and Diversification

* Diversification of risk for asset portfolios
* Recourse decisions, the newsvendor problem, and why there are after-Christmas sales
* Hedging Risk 
* Real Options Analysis

## Texts and Other Materials #

### Primary Text ###

*Operations Management 10/e* by Jay Heizer and Barry Render. Published in 2008 by Pearson Education. ([amazon hardcover](http://www.amazon.com/Operations-Management-10th-Edition-Heizer/dp/0136119417)) ([amazon paperback](http://www.amazon.com/Operations-Management-Flexible-Version-Edition/dp/0132163926/))


### Software ##

A key objective of this course is to provide students with the skills necessary to formulate and solve problems in operations management.  This objective is facilitated if students have individual access to software tools for implementation.

* **IPython.** Many of the course topics will be illustrated with examples coded and made available in the form of [IPython notebooks](http://jckantor.github.io/ESTM60203/).
* **GLPK/MathProg.** GLPK/MathProg is provides open source implementation of AMPL, an industry standard  language for operations and decisions. This course will use a [unique, web-based implementation](http://www3.nd.edu/~jeff/mathprog/mathprog.html) to facilitate learning and subsequent applications development.

## Assignments ##

As part of the learning experience, students will develop models for three case studies, some additional exercises, and develop an application in their own area of interest.

## Learning Outcomes

This module provides an overview of selected concepts in Applied Operations Research. The course is organized around a general theme of modeling and optimization for process operations, with the main attention on techniques for modeling and solving problems in process operations, managing complex systems of activities, and understanding the role of uncertainty in capital allocation and planning.

Students completing this module will be able to:

1. Formulate, model in a mathematical programming language, and compute solutions for small to medium scale applications of linear programming in process operations, including binary and integer decision variables.
2.  and solve network, transportation, and related logistics optimization problems of small to medium scale.
3. Prepare a critical path analysis for medium scale projects, identify the critical path, find earliest finish times and latest start times.
4. Analyze job shop and flow shop performance for deterministic conditions under common prioritization schedules, including FIFO, LIFO, EDD, and SDT.
5. Calculate optimal schedules for job and flow shops under deterministic constraints.
6. Formulate and solve capital allocation problem using mean/variance analysis of return and risk.
7. Calculate optimal inventories using two-stage stochastic decision models with recourse.
8. Prepare decision trees and solve for expected mean value, expected value of perfect information.
9. Analyze case studies using selected tools from Operations Research.

## Grading #

A grade will be assigned based on in-class participation and performance on assignments, a short project, and a course project. The project will be due on the last day of the course.
